Ten years ago I was invited by a newly form art society to paint the first of what they intended to be a series of murals. Their purpose being to enlarge the towns culture and understanding of their heritage, as well as to bring beauty and commerce to the area.

I felt the first mural needed to reflect well the essence of Wittenberg's character. Also it had to be something to cherish for long time to come (no tasteless garishness or billboard like colors. Something that all, art lovers, connoisseurs, as well as the folks living here and all around that may visit would find it a meditative peaceful viewing experience. "An American Fresco " as it is known now around the country and in Europe became that piece of art. The actual title is "Foundation of Faith", well reflecting Wittenberg's original goals and its propelling force so based in the Faith of many to provided a safe place for the widowed women, and shelter for youth in need. So I recommend to you, a trip to Wittenberg this coming weekend, October 2,3 and 4 for the anniversary celebration. You'll not be disappointed.
